# This page has moved

The canonical, user-facing version now lives here:

- docs/user/Telescope-Based Planetary Datasets (UV-VIS and IR).md

Why the move:

- Consolidate user guides under `docs/user/` for in-app visibility.
- Avoid duplicate copies in `docs/` root and `docs/uploads/`.

If you landed here from an older link, please update your references to the canonical path above.
