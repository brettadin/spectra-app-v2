# Capability Atlas — repository-wide feature and cleanup digest

- **Timestamp (America/New_York / UTC)**: 2025-11-02T10:43:33-05:00 / 2025-11-02T15:43:35+00:00
- **Why**: Prior inventory feedback noted that stakeholders could not see how active services, UI affordances, and dormant features fit
  together. We needed a single, narrative artifact that maps capabilities, missing pieces, and cleanup tasks.

## Key Points
- Authored `docs/app_capabilities.md`, a 500+ line atlas covering UI layout, remote services, importer coverage, overlays, exports,
  logging rituals, and forward-looking enhancements.
- Documented known gaps (calibration service, identification stack, dataset removal UI) alongside technical-debt hotspots (remote worker
  duplication, importer heuristics, doc redundancy).
- Seeded cleanup and enhancement task ideas so the workplan can break them into actionable tickets without losing context.
