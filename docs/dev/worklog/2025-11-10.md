### Summary
- Enabled direct ingest of ASCII `.dat` spectra via the existing CSV importer.
- Documented the new workflow and backfilled regression coverage so the extension stays registered.

### Changes
- Registered `.dat` with `DataIngestService` and updated UI filters/constants to surface the extension.
- Added a sample `.dat` fixture plus ingest and smoke assertions to exercise the flow end to end.
- Refreshed `docs/user/importing.md` with guidance on when `.dat` works versus when to pre-process binary PDS tables.

### Validation
- `pytest tests/test_ingest.py tests/test_smoke_workflow.py`
