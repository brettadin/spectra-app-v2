## [Entry #2] 14:48 (Local ET) / 19:48Z (UTC) — Agent: ChatGPT

### Summary
- Fixed the sluggishness introduced by the theme selector by avoiding redundant global stylesheet passes and caching QSS output per palette.

### Changes
- app/main.py — removed duplicate theme bootstrap work so the main window owns palette orchestration.
- app/ui/main_window.py — tracked the applied theme key, skipped redundant restyles, and reapplied plot styling without touching the global stylesheet.
- app/ui/styles.py — cached generated stylesheets to keep rapid theme toggles responsive.
- docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md — logged the regression fix with timestamps.
- docs/history/KNOWLEDGE_LOG.md — captured rationale and references for the performance fix.

### Files touched
- app/main.py — launcher no longer reapplies the stylesheet before the window manages themes.
- app/ui/main_window.py — centralised theme lifecycle, prevented duplicate `setStyleSheet` calls, and refreshed plots explicitly.
- app/ui/styles.py — memoized theme stylesheet builder.
- docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md — added the theme performance entry.
- docs/history/KNOWLEDGE_LOG.md — recorded the fix in the history log.

### Verification
- [ ] Unit/integration tests run locally — `pytest` (fails: Qt requires libGL in this container). Notes: ImportError for `libGL.so.1` when importing PySide6 during test collection.【e42a4a†L4-L39】
- [ ] Manual UI smoke steps
- Notes: Headless container cannot launch Qt to observe the startup improvement directly; relying on code inspection.

### Documentation updates
- PATCH_NOTES.md: added 2025-11-12 14:48 ET entry covering the performance fix.
- KNOWLEDGE_LOG.md: logged the rationale, impact, and references.
- Guides/specs updated: none required (user workflow unchanged).

### Next steps
- Consider headless UI tests to assert stylesheet application counts when Qt offscreen support is available.
- Investigate lightweight performance counters or logging around theme switches to catch regressions earlier.

## [Entry #1] 13:23 (Local ET) / 18:23Z (UTC) — Agent: ChatGPT

### Summary
- Added a selectable theme system with light, dark, and midnight presets plus immediate plot restyling.

### Changes
- app/ui/themes.py — new theme registry and palette metadata.
- app/ui/styles.py — stylesheet builder and pyqtgraph config now theme-aware.
- app/ui/main_window.py — persisted theme preference, View → Theme menu, live application updates.
- app/ui/plot_pane.py — exposes `apply_theme` so axes/legend/crosshair follow the active palette.
- docs/user/plot_tools.md — documented how to switch themes.

### Files touched
- app/ui/themes.py — define theme definitions and helpers.
- app/ui/styles.py — generate QSS per theme and sync pyqtgraph config.
- app/ui/main_window.py — wire theme menu, persistence, and runtime updates.
- app/ui/plot_pane.py — restyle plot elements when the theme changes.
- docs/user/plot_tools.md — describe the theme switcher workflow.
- docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md — logged the feature.
- docs/history/KNOWLEDGE_LOG.md — recorded the change with references.

### Verification
- [ ] Unit/integration tests run locally — `pytest` (fails: PySide6 requires libGL in this container).  
  Notes: `ImportError: libGL.so.1` during Qt test collection prevents suite execution.【ff63bc†L1-L33】
- [ ] Manual UI smoke steps
- Notes: Unable to launch Qt UI in headless container to validate menus; relying on code review.

### Documentation updates
- PATCH_NOTES.md: added entry under 2025-11-12T13:23:12-05:00.
- KNOWLEDGE_LOG.md: added entry with references.
- Guides/specs updated: docs/user/plot_tools.md.

### Next steps
- Add automated coverage that verifies the theme menu toggles stylesheet/pyqtgraph values when a headless Qt backend is available.
- Consider surfacing a preference panel for accent overrides once the theme registry stabilises.
