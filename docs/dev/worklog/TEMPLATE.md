# Worklog — YYYY-MM-DD (America/New_York)

Policy: One file per real calendar day in America/New_York. If you work multiple times in a day, append additional entries to the same file and increment the entry number.
Tip: Run `python tools/worklog_helper.py` to print today's ET filename suggestion and a header stub with ET/UTC times.
