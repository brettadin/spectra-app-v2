# Spectra App Capability Atlas (2025-11-02)

*Compiled 2025-11-02T10:43:33-05:00 / 2025-11-02T15:43:35+00:00 by agent.*

This atlas is an exhaustive, narrative map of everything the Spectra desktop application currently does, the pathways that make
those features possible, the diagnostic signals proving they still work, and the seams where functionality has regressed or was
partially reimplemented over time. It aggregates implementation notes, UI affordances, service behaviors, regression coverage,
and repository hygiene opportunities into one location so future maintainers can see the full operational surface without having
to stitch together dozens of documents.
