# Relating Lab Spectra to Astronomical Data

## Using Reference Standards for Calibration

Before comparing different spectra, it's crucial to calibrate and validate the lab data against known standards. Start by recording emission line wavelengths (and relative intensities) from your known element lamps. For example, measure prominent lines for pure element lamps (like hydrogen, helium, neon, etc.) and note their wavelengths and intensities. Then retrieve the accepted standard values for those lines – for instance, from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (which provides critically evaluated wavelengths and transition data)[1]. For each line, calculate how close your measured wavelength is to the standard:

Compute the absolute difference (e.g. in nm or cm⁻¹) between the measured line position and the NIST value.

You can also express the error as a percentage of the reference value to gauge relative accuracy. For example, an error of 0.2 nm on a 600 nm line is a 0.033% difference.

If you find a consistent offset (e.g. all lines are shifted ~0.5 nm higher than NIST), you likely have a calibration bias – you can correct this by adjusting your wavelength calibration curve so that known lines match the reference (many labs use a polynomial fit to map pixel to wavelength, anchored by known lamp lines[2]). Record the RMS error of your calibration – ideally your measured lines should be within the instrument's resolution or error tolerance after calibration. Modern reference data are extremely precise (NIST can pin line positions to within parts per billion in wavelength)[3], so any remaining discrepancy essentially reflects your experimental uncertainty. By the end of this step, you have quantified how “true” your lab’s AES (Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) data is compared to standard references.

Perform a similar validation for your FTIR molecular spectra. You mentioned using known molecular samples (H₂O, CO₂ gas) and recording their IR absorption bands and intensities. Compare these against standard reference spectra – for example, known band positions from databases or literature (NIST Chemistry WebBook, or spectroscopy databases like HITRAN/ExoMol for molecular lines[4]). Check that the wavenumbers (or wavelengths) of key absorption peaks in your FTIR spectra align with accepted values for those vibrational modes. Compute the differences for each identified band center just as you did for atomic lines. Because FTIR peaks have finite bandwidth, also verify that your measured band shapes (approximate widths) are reasonable. Many labs use standard samples for this purpose (e.g. a polystyrene film or a reference gas cell) to calibrate the wavenumber axis[5]. If your H₂O and CO₂ peaks are within a few cm⁻¹ of the published positions, that's a good confirmation that your FTIR frequency scale is accurate. Any systematic offset can be corrected by adjusting the interferometer calibration (often FTIR instruments have an internal laser reference, but a slight tweak might be logged if, say, the polystyrene film peaks are off by a constant factor[6]). Now you have your molecular IR data validated as well.

In both cases (atomic and molecular), using these standard references “keeps you grounded.” It gives students a concrete way to quantify accuracy: for each line or band they can report a deviation from the standard (in nm or cm⁻¹, and perhaps %). This exercise builds good analytical habits by having them cross-check their results with authoritative data. They learn that every instrument has some error, and how to measure and correct for it. It also sets the stage for comparing unknown spectra to known signatures with confidence that “our data lines up with NIST within, say, ±0.1 nm, so we can reliably identify elements in other spectra using that tolerance.”

## Converting and Aligning Spectral Scales

When comparing spectra from different sources (lab vs. telescope), it's essential to align them to common units and scales. Astronomical spectra might be given in different units (often wavelength in nm or µm for optical/IR, or wavenumber in cm⁻¹ for IR, or frequency for radio). Make sure to convert your lab data and the astro data to a consistent unit. For example, if your telescope data is in wavenumbers (common for IR observations), you can convert it to nanometers using  [7]. This ensures features from the FTIR (recorded in cm⁻¹) can be directly compared to features in a spectrum given in nm or µm. Be mindful of vacuum vs air wavelength conventions as well – many laboratory references (NIST ASD) list vacuum wavelengths for UV/visible lines. Telescope data might be referenced to vacuum or to air depending on the source; the difference is small in the optical but can be ~0.1 nm for some lines, so if high precision is needed you can apply the slight correction (using Edlén’s formula for air dispersion as noted in your documentation).

Next, consider the spectral range and resolution. The data sets may not cover exactly the same wavelength range. For instance, your AES lab data might span the visible (~400–700 nm) while a telescope observation (say of a star or planet) could extend into the near-IR (800+ nm) or beyond. Identify any overlapping region first – if there is one, that’s where direct comparison is easiest. In non-overlapping regions, you will have to rely on reference data rather than your own measured lines (e.g. if the telescope observes a 1000 nm line of an element that your lab lamp didn’t cover, you would use the known reference wavelength for that line to recognize it, since you validated your instrument with other lines of that element). In essence, your lab measurements plus the standard reference databases together form a library of “expected lines” across a broad range.

You should also reconcile spectral resolution differences. Laboratory instruments often have high resolution, producing very sharp lines, whereas astronomical spectra (especially from distant or faint objects) might be lower resolution. A narrow atomic line in the lab could appear as a broader or even blended feature in a telescope spectrum. To compare them, it helps to degrade the resolution of the reference data to match the telescope data[8]. In practice, this could mean smoothing or convolving your high-res lab spectrum with an instrument line-spread function so that the line widths mimic the telescope’s resolution. This is a more advanced step and might be handled by your app or given as an instructor-provided correction, rather than done manually by students. But students should qualitatively understand that if a line is, say, 0.05 nm wide in the lab but the telescope’s spectrograph has a resolution of 0.5 nm, then in the astro spectrum that line will appear ten times broader (or even indistinguishable from noise if very narrow). Emphasize that comparison must be apples-to-apples: align the units and consider resolution. If needed, re-bin one spectrum to the same wavelength grid as the other for direct point-by-point comparisons.

Finally, check for any Doppler shifts or systematic offsets in the astro data. Astronomical sources might have a velocity relative to us (e.g. a star’s radial velocity, or an exoplanet’s orbital motion) causing all its spectral lines to shift slightly (redshift or blueshift). If you notice that, for example, all the lines in the star’s spectrum are displaced by +0.2 nm compared to where your lab expects them, that's likely a Doppler shift. You can have students calculate that velocity using  (a good real-world application of the Doppler formula). In most cases, you might simply adjust for the shift by subtracting that offset so the lines line up. (Your documentation even notes to apply such shifts to templates, not raw data, during matching[9] – conceptually, you’re sliding the reference spectrum until it aligns with the observation.) Having students make this small adjustment reinforces understanding of Doppler effect in spectra, but ensure the calculation is kept simple or provided as needed so it doesn't overwhelm the main exercise.

## Identifying Species via Spectral Line Matching

Now comes the exciting part: using the calibrated lab references to identify elements and molecules in the astronomical data. The principle here is that every element or molecule has a unique spectral "fingerprint" – a distinct pattern of lines or bands – and the goal is to see which fingerprints are present in the telescope spectrum[10]. There are two complementary approaches you mentioned: line-by-line matching and overall pattern matching.

1. Line-by-line identification (Atomic spectra): For each element of interest, you likely have a list of its strongest spectral lines (from your lab measurements or from NIST data). For example, if you're looking for sodium, you know to expect the famous close pair of lines around 589.0 nm (the Na D-doublet), or for hydrogen you expect the Balmer series lines (656.3 nm Hα, 486.1 nm Hβ, etc.), for oxygen maybe the green line at 557.7 nm (if emission) or certain absorption lines if looking at a star. Have the students go through the astro spectrum and mark where these known reference lines would appear. They can overlay markers or simply write them down. Then check the astro data: Is there a spectral feature (emission peak or absorption dip) at those wavelengths? If yes, record it as a potential match. They should find multiple lines for each candidate element to be confident. Just like a fingerprint, one line could be a coincidence, but if several known lines of the same element all show up, it's strong evidence that element is present.

For each matched line, note the observed intensity relative to expectation. If your spectrum is of a star or reflected sunlight, lines will appear as dark absorption lines; their depth (how much light is absorbed) can indicate the element’s abundance qualitatively. If it's an emission spectrum (e.g. a nebula or lamp), the brightness of the line suggests how much of that element is emitting. Students can compare relative line intensities to reference values: e.g., if in a reference spectrum line A is usually twice as strong as line B, do we see a similar ratio in the astronomical data? This can get tricky because astrophysical conditions (temperature, pressure) affect line intensity, but a rough correspondence reinforces the identification. As NASA educational materials note, the pattern of lines identifies the element, and the line brightness/strength gives clues to the element’s abundance in the source[10]. They might notice, for instance, that an element appearing in only very faint lines could mean it’s present in low abundance (or cooler temperature), whereas strong prominent lines mean a higher concentration (all else equal).

After checking all expected lines for an element, also ensure there are no “extra” strong lines in the data that you can't explain with that element or others being considered. If you find lines in the astro spectrum that don't correspond to any of your lab-reference elements, that's either a hint of an element you haven't considered (time to consult the reference database for what has a line at that wavelength) or perhaps an instrumental artifact. Students can be encouraged to hypothesize what unknown lines might be, using databases (the app’s reference library or NIST ASD search) to find what species has a line at, say, 658 nm if something unexplained shows up. This is exactly how astronomers identify new elements in stars – by matching unknown lines to laboratory data.

A simple scoring approach here could be: for each element, count the number of expected lines that were observed in the astro spectrum (within a tolerance). Also count how many expected strong lines were missing or how many observed lines were unassigned. An element with, say, 5 out of 6 major lines matched (and no major contradictions) is very likely present. This could be translated into a confidence score or just a qualitative rating (high confidence identification vs tentative). You could have students make a table listing each candidate species, the lines matched, their wavelength error, and maybe intensity ratios, to summarize their findings.

2. Pattern matching / overall comparison: Instead of (or in addition to) checking each line manually, you can have students compare the overall spectral pattern of their lab data with the astronomical spectrum. For example, if your class measured a whole spectrum of a multi-element lamp or a mixture (or if your software can overlay a reference spectrum from literature), you could overlay that on the telescope spectrum to see if the features line up. This is essentially what professionals do with "template matching" – e.g., overlaying a known solar spectrum or known molecular spectrum and shifting it to see if it fits. Students might do this qualitatively by plotting them together and inspecting where peaks and dips coincide. A more quantitative approach (probably done by the app or a script) is to compute a cross-correlation or a similarity score: this involves shifting one spectrum against the other and seeing where the best alignment occurs (peaks reinforcing peaks). A high correlation at zero shift would mean the patterns match well. Another measure could be a chi-squared goodness-of-fit between the observed spectrum and a scaled combination of reference spectra of various species. That might be beyond hand-calculation, but it's worth mentioning that algorithms exist to automate multi-line identification by essentially trying to match all known patterns (your documentation alludes to a future “identification stack” with peak scoring and explainable scorecards)[11]. For the students, you could simplify pattern matching to a visual task or provide a printed reference spectrum for them to compare against the astro data printout.

Total match metric: If you want a single number to tell “how close” their data is to a reference, you could calculate something like a mean wavelength error across all identified lines, or a fraction of lines matched. For instance, “Our measured spectrum of Element X has an average deviation of 0.05 nm from NIST values across 5 lines, and we identified the same 5 lines in the star’s spectrum with an average offset of 0.07 nm.” The smaller the offsets, the closer their data is to the standard, and by extension, the more confidently we identify the species in the star. Another simple metric: take the list of top N lines in the reference data for a species and see what percentage of those appear (above noise) in the astro spectrum. If nearly all appear, it's a strong match (score ~100%); if only one out of five expected lines is seen, that's weak evidence. This way, instead of doing detailed calculations for every line in a lengthy table, a student can summarize, “Element X matched 4/5 of its signature lines, within 0.1 nm error, so we conclude X is present.” Such a summary still derives from the line-by-line checks but is easier to digest.

In practice, both approaches complement each other. The line-by-line method ensures students pay attention to each feature and understand the origin, while the overall pattern method is how they'll later aggregate all evidence for a given species. You may guide them to do a bit of both: perhaps first identify obvious lines manually, then use the app or a provided reference overlay to catch any subtle matches they missed.

## Identifying Molecules in Astronomical Spectra (FTIR vs Telescope Data)

Identifying molecules (like H₂O, CO₂) in an astronomical spectrum uses a similar idea but with broad molecular bands instead of sharp atomic lines. Your students have FTIR data for water and carbon dioxide, which show characteristic absorption band patterns (consisting of many closely spaced lines). Now, say you have an exoplanet transit spectrum or a planetary atmosphere spectrum from a telescope – these often show molecular absorption features at certain wavelength regions. The goal is to see if the molecular signatures they measured in the lab appear in the astro data.

Have the students note the key band positions from their FTIR spectra: e.g., water vapor has strong IR bands around ~6.3 µm (~1600 cm⁻¹, the H-O-H bending mode) and around 2.7 µm (~3700 cm⁻¹, O-H stretch), and CO₂ has a major band at ~4.3 µm (~2350 cm⁻¹) and 15 µm (~667 cm⁻¹). If the astronomical spectrum (perhaps from JWST or another observatory) covers those wavelengths, check if it shows absorption features at those points. Often in exoplanet transmission spectra (where you see starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere), these molecules reveal themselves as broad dips in the spectrum at the expected wavelengths. For example, recent JWST observations of exoplanet WASP-39b clearly showed the presence of H₂O and CO₂ by such features[12]. Students can overlay the lab FTIR spectrum (properly scaled/normalized) on the telescope spectrum if possible. Even if the resolution differs, the envelope of the absorption can be compared – does the telescope spectrum drop in the same regions where the lab spectrum (or reference) has peaks? This comparison might be a bit qualitative (by eye) unless the app can do a cross-correlation. One could conceive a simple calculation: e.g., integrate the area of the observed absorption band and compare it to what you expect for a certain column of gas (though detailed quantification would require knowing things like the planet's atmospheric scale height, line strength, etc., which is probably beyond the scope). Instead, a simpler calculation could be to measure the band center and width in the astro spectrum and see if it matches the lab. For instance, “we see a broad absorption from 4.2 to 4.5 µm peaking at 4.3 µm, which matches the CO₂ band position (within a few nm or a few cm⁻¹) that we recorded in the lab.” They could calculate the difference: maybe the astro CO₂ band center is at 2345 cm⁻¹ vs the lab 2350 cm⁻¹, a ~5 cm⁻¹ (~0.2%) discrepancy, which is very close. That gives confidence that the identification is correct.

When multiple molecules are present, their bands might overlap or influence each other. Encourage students to look at the pattern: e.g., water has multiple bands, so if they see one water band, check for another (JWST saw several H₂O bands in that exoplanet). If all expected molecular features are present, it solidifies the finding. If one expected band is missing, that might indicate the data doesn’t cover that range or the molecule’s abundance is lower (e.g., maybe a CO₂ band at 15 µm wasn’t seen because the observation was in near-IR only). This teaches them to be cautious and to consider the limitations of the data range.

Just as with elements, the strength of a molecular absorption band can hint at abundance. A deeper, more prominent band means more of that gas (or a longer path length). Students could, for a basic exercise, compare the depth of an absorption feature: e.g., “the star’s light was reduced by 1% at the peak of the water band”. If they know their lab spectrum's transmittance for a certain concentration/path length, they could very roughly infer if the astronomical absorption corresponds to a similar amount of water. (This is essentially using Beer–Lambert law qualitatively:  – larger absorbance A means either higher concentration c or longer path ℓ[13].) In a simple way: If CO₂ produces a 50% absorption in the lab cell and we see a 5% dip in the exoplanet spectrum, the exoplanet likely has a much smaller column of CO₂ than our cell – which makes sense! While precise retrieval of abundance requires complex modeling, making order-of-magnitude comparisons can be illuminating for students.

To keep things manageable: perhaps assign each group of students one element or molecule to focus on, have them do the above for that species, and then combine the class results. This way one group might become the “sodium team,” another the “water vapor team,” etc. They perform the comparison, calculate how close the match is for their assigned species, and report if that species is present in the astro target and with what confidence. The class as a whole then assembles the likely composition of the astronomical object from all the identified signatures.

## Drawing Conclusions and Next Steps

By relating their own gathered data to real astronomical spectra, students practice the full pipeline of data analysis and interpretation: calibrating measurements, comparing to standards, identifying patterns, and making evidence-based claims about what substances are present. The calculations they perform (wavelength offsets, percentage errors, intensity ratios, etc.) give a quantitative backbone to what could otherwise be just a “eyeball” comparison. These numbers can be consolidated into an analysis report for the object observed. For example, they might conclude:

“In the telescope spectrum, we identified hydrogen (H I) by matching 4 out of 4 of its strongest lines (within 0.5 Å of their lab values). The average deviation was only 0.3 Å, which is within our calibration error. The Hα line was the deepest absorption, suggesting hydrogen is abundant[10].

We also found sodium (Na I), as evidenced by the pair of lines near 589 nm aligning with the Na doublet we measured – those lines were weaker than hydrogen’s lines, implying a lower Na abundance relative to H.”

“For molecules, we detected a water vapor band around 6.2–6.5 µm in the exoplanet data, which coincides with the H₂O band we recorded (centered at 6.27 µm). The feature’s depth (~1% dimming) is small but significant. We also see a clear CO₂ band at 4.3 µm; its position matches our lab reference within ~0.01 µm. This confirms H₂O and CO₂ in the planetary atmosphere.”

In essence, students use their laboratory as a training ground for spectral interpretation, then apply that skill to the cosmos. The ultimate goal, as you said, is to eventually have them contribute to real data analysis – churning through exoplanet spectra in search of chemical fingerprints. By starting with known comparisons (their data vs NIST vs known mixtures) they gain confidence in their instrument and technique. The next step is more open-ended: given a mystery spectrum from a star or planet, what do you think is in it? They will rely on the same process – look up reference lines, compare patterns, make hypotheses – just as real scientists do when analyzing new observations.

To keep things student-friendly, ensure the calculations are scaffolded. The app can automate repetitive tasks like computing all the wavelength differences or doing the cross-correlation, allowing students to focus on interpreting the results. For instance, the software might highlight all peaks in the star’s spectrum and label likely element matches (using your reference library of lines[14]), and then students verify those suggestions with their own reasoning. They should understand the output: if the app says “Element X score: 90% match”, they should be able to explain that means “we found almost all of X’s fingerprint lines in the data at the expected places.” By comparing their collective findings with official data (perhaps even sending results to NASA or checking against literature values for that object), they get feedback on their accuracy. This not only validates the concept but is highly motivating – they see that the spectral analysis they did is real science.

In summary, to relate their AES and FTIR data to telescope spectra, they should:

Calibrate & quantify accuracy using standards (NIST atomic lines, known molecular bands) – compute how close their measurements are to known values as a baseline.

Convert and align all datasets to common units and account for differences (wavelength vs wavenumber, resolution, any systematic shifts) so comparisons are valid[7][8].

Match spectral features: use their calibrated lab “fingerprints” to find corresponding lines/bands in the astro data, either by checking each major line or overlaying patterns. Identify species by multiple confirmed features, not just one.

Calculate simple metrics to measure closeness: e.g. wavelength error for each line, fraction of expected lines observed, intensity ratios, band position shifts. These provide a numeric measure of “how close their data is” to reference and to the astro features.

Infer presence and abundance qualitatively: use the presence of lines to confirm a species, and use line or band strengths to reason about relative abundance (remembering other factors can play a role)[10]. For example, if two elements are identified, the one with more and stronger lines is likely more abundant in that source.

Report findings with both qualitative identification and quantitative confidence. This could include a comparison table and a narrative conclusion about the composition of the astronomical target.

By following these steps, students tie together the entire workflow from laboratory spectroscopy to astrophysical discovery. It's a powerful demonstration that the same physics applies in a lamp, on Earth, and in a distant star or planet. With careful comparisons and simple calculations to keep them grounded, they can contribute meaningfully – even if just as a proof-of-concept – to analyzing cosmic spectra. In fact, analyses like these (identifying sodium, potassium, water, CO₂, etc. in exoplanets) are exactly how we know what other worlds are made of[12]. Your approach will train a new generation of observers who cut their teeth on real data, developing both technical skills and a deeper conceptual understanding of spectroscopy. This is a big step toward the ultimate goal: one day having students collectively identify new species or measure abundances in exoplanet atmospheres, effectively doing frontline research as part of their education.
