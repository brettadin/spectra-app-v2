# Samples directory

Curated example datasets and manifests for tutorials, tests, and demos.

Pending reorg (non-breaking):
- test_fixtures/ — minimal CSV/FITS for automated tests
- calibration_standards/ — lab standards and reference spectra
- solar_system/ — planetary and lunar spectra (already present)
- exoplanets/ — exoplanet spectra and catalogs (already present)
- laboratory/ — miscellaneous lab spectra not used as standards

Note: Existing files remain in their original locations to avoid breaking
paths referenced by docs or tests. We will migrate incrementally and leave
pointer READMEs in legacy folders if needed.
