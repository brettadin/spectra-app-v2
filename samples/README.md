# Samples (tiny demos only)

This folder now holds only tiny, fast-loading examples for quick demos and smoke tests.

What remains here:
- A small solar CSV (sun redo)
- One compact IR CO2 example (`IR data/IR - CO2/CO2 - 500 torr A.csv`)
- Minimal fixtures under `test_fixtures/`

Heavier datasets (full IR matrices, lamp sets, Sun/Moon collections, SpeX FITS library, planetary data) have moved to `storage/curated/` to keep the repo lightweight while preserving rich examples.

See `storage/curated/README.md` for an index and how to use curated data in the app.
